    "# Do You Wanna Develop an App? Free App Profitability on Online Marketplaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothetical client has asked us to make recommendations for a new app. The client's intention is to build an iOs and Android mobile app, and wants us to provide analysis of existing apps to aid their development. The client wishes to make an app for an English-speaking audience that is free to install, and does not offer additional in-app purchases; the revenue will come from in-app advertisements. We conclude that their revenue will be most closely tied to the app's number of users, and will use this as the starting point of our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will find through this analysis that there are untapped markets in the free app space. These markets are indicated by high numbers of users and reviews, but low numbers of overall apps in those categories. We will identify one such example, and explain how to find others using our results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finding, Opening, and Exploring the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "As of September 2018, both of these marketplaces had over 2 million available apps.\n",

    "Gathering 4 million data points for our analysis is both too costly and time consuming for our hypothetical client, and also beyond the real-world scope of this project. Instead, we'll be taking a sample of data scraped from the web by users lava18 and ramamet4 and posted to Kaggle.com. Thank you to those users for making this data available to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two data sets we will be using were retrieved in September 2021. Our [first data set](https://www.kaggle.com/lava18/google-play-store-apps) provides 10841 app entries from the Google Play Store in February 2019. Our [second data set](https://www.kaggle.com/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps) provides 7197 app entries from the Mobile App Store in June 2018. Let's open and explore the data to get a sense of where we're starting."

    "These numbers are much more informative. We see that the median Android Game or Entertainment app does better than almost any other category on that marketplace, and the same is true of Productivity and Reference apps on the Apple store. This is an interesting contrast to the observation we made earlier, where the frequency tables showed more productive Android apps and more iOs games.\n",

    "\n",
    "When there are more apps in a given genre, there will be more competition among those apps, so they will get less users overall. Genres with fewer apps but higher numbers of users and reviews might indicate a market where demand exceeds supply. Our client is looking for an app idea that will generate the most users and engagement, and therefore the most ad revenue. We want to recommend to our client make an app in a genre that has:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generally high numbers of reviews on both app marketplaces\n",
    "2. A lower total number of apps than average\n",
    "\n",
    "Using these criteria, our recommendation to our client would be to look into developing a Shopping app.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shopping genre ranks 4 out of 23 and 5 out of 33 for median number of reviews on Apple and Android markets, respectively. But shopping ranks in the middle of both frequency tables for number of apps per genre. This indicates that there is high demand for these kinds of apps, but there's not so much competition that our client's app would get buried among a sea of similar products.\n",

    "In this project I've used Python in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open, read, and formatted .csv files into lists of lists\n",
    "2. Cleaned the data of incomplete rows, non-English strings, and duplicate apps\n",
    "3. Defined functions that created and displayed frequency tables\n",
    "4. Ran loops within loops to find means and medians for each sub-group of our data\n",
